  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p class="centerImage" style="background-color: rgb(173, 173, 173); display: inline">
    A serial killer haunts the city of Vancouver, only targeting beautiful women. The case reveals a strange connection with a high school bombing that took place over two thousand kilometers away.
Meanwhile, an egotistic video blogger, an anti-social photographer, a judgmental taxi driver, and a neurotic police detective begin their own hunt for the killer's identity while simultaneously following each other for their own personal reasons. What starts as harmless acts of curious following quickly escalates into an intense mission to bring the killer to their individual versions of justice, and they unknowingly tangle themselves in more danger than they ever imagined.

<h1>Main Characters:</h1>

<article>

    <strong>Darren Merlot</strong>
        <p>(27) an over-eager, obsessive, and obnoxious, and strikingly hansome YouTube partner who makes spare money from his subscribers and his views, talking about city life and culture. He is described around the city as a “typical Vancouver douchebag” due to his noticeable disregard for women (often described as his agreeing thoughts with the killer), and also feels hatred and animosity towards specifically promiscuous and sinful women, regarding them as committing sins and abusing god’s gift. He constantly goes to bars with his friends and disrespects women, and does not believe in love, marriage, commitment, etc. He is said to be suffering from a narcissistic psychological disorder, which explains why he feels that his existence is so much higher than others and that his importance is better than others. He had also won the lottery, and had dropped out of the University of British Columbia (majoring in English), which is why he lives so comfortably and does not go to school but instead makes small income off YouTube. In his spare time, he has feelings of murder and feels like murdering women around the city who seem to be “sluts” and he constantly stalks individual women who sleep with various men, hoping to build up the courage to murder them one day.</p>

    <strong>Tessa Calister</strong>
        <p>(24) an antisocial, scene-covered perfectionist (known to have OCD) with half of her head shaved off, is a gym-freak with plastic breasts, who hates men, since when she was younger her brother and her father raped and abused her, causing her to live with her abnormal aunt who is suffering from severe schizophrenia and lives in a mental hospital, and who she visits every now and then, although she can never understand her aunt. She is therefore a lesbian who calls many of her girlfriends over and has sex with them. She calls many women over to sleep with them, but still says she is neither straight or gay. She hates men who hate women, and also men who are pigs and only care about sex, hates obnoxious men who think too much of themselves, conceited men. She does not go to school, but instead works full time at a gymnasium, but has an obsessive hobby of photography and somehow takes pictures of everything. She also follows cheating men around, following them to their homes and takes photos of them and hangs on her wall (hoping to murder all of them one day), and also sometimes puts a mask on and threatens the men with a knife, leaving death threats and then leaving the scene. </p>
    
    <strong>Randy Faulk</strong>
        <p>(24) a discriminative, and racist taxi driver who lives in a small, trashed apartment in east Vancouver. He had grown up with a bad childhood raised by foster parents who did drugs. Growing up, he was always picked on for his small stature and beat up many times, causing him to grow hate for everybody and for some reason, hate for other ethnicities and sexual orientations. Growing up to be a thin, muscleless drug dealer covered in tattoos, he hates nearly everything and everyone around him, and never looks forward to anything and instead stays at home most of the time smoking marijuana and shooting heroin.  Aside from his work as a taxi driver, he stalks gay people around the city, hoping to kill them one day. </p>
   
    <strong>Inspector Colin Chang</strong>
        <p>(39) the city detective working on the murders</p>
